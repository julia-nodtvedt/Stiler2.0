		<p>Although Natasha Oakley may be be renowned for living in a bikini, there is so much more to be admired with this Australian beauty than what meets the eye. Natasha Oakley Blog is a simply a depiction of Natasha’s passions- style, travel and photography.</p>

		<p>“I have always felt a duty to motivate and inspire my family, friends and followers to be confident and follow their dreams. I will never put a minute of my time into something I am not passionate about. I love waking up in the morning with a goal or a project that needs to be conquered and if there isn’t one I will create one! Everything on my blog is very true to my personal style and a true reflection of my personality”</p>

		<p>Natasha acquired a large following and fan base through her social media platforms whom demanded more “Natasha”, a photo a day of her adventures was not enough, they wanted to know where her clothes where from, what her beauty regime was and where she was staying during her travels! Natasha being so passionate about photography, travel and fashion created her newest project Natasha Oakley Blog so she could share more with her followers who are inspired by her individuality and inspirational attitude.</p>

		<p>“Like every business or project that I create I set out to inspire individuals, in particular woman. There is something so beautiful about a confident woman. Being a curvaceous girl myself I like to show women all over the world that they can look great in clothes or a bikini, everyone should feel at home in their own skin. Many girls are discouraged by fashion designers and magazines who depict a slimmer figure as being aspirational, however I think that curves look amazing in clothes! High fashion should not be confined to any sort of person, it should be accessible to all shapes and sizes”!</p>

		<p>Natasha has a unique sense of style which mixes a relaxed/ beachy chic look inspired by Hawaii, Miami and Byron Bay with modern high fashion trends inspired by New York, Los Angeles, Paris and Sydney. She believes women should always look sexy but in a classy and mysterious way, not giving to much away</p>
